"""
Basic RAG Example
================
This example demonstrates the simplest usage of funkydspy with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
function that takes a context and question, returning a string answer.

# Expected output format:
# Prediction(
#     reasoning='The statement indicates that Lee scored twice last season, which means he scored 2 goals during that period. The phrase "scored twice" directly refers to the number of goals, so the total goals scored by Lee is 2.',
